# Node Backend Kickstart

Para a versão em português deste README, clique [aqui](README.md).

Node Backend Kickstart is a boilerplate project created to help you quickly set up a Node.js application with a customizable folder structure, TypeScript support, and pre-configuration for connecting to several databases.

## 🎯 Motivation

This project started as a participation in the [Neon Open Source Starter Kit Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/neon) by [DEV Community](https://dev.to) and also serves as an "extension" of my previous project, ["react-starter"](https://github.com/fonteeboa/react-starter). While "react-starter" focuses on frontend (client) development, Node Backend Kickstart was created to simplify our day-to-day backend (server) development, providing a solid foundation that includes configuration for various databases and a well-defined folder structure.

The idea is to expand this project to cover more than just initialization, incorporating aspects of security and integrations. The goal is for Node Backend Kickstart to evolve into a solid foundation for complete solutions, both on the frontend and backend, enabling full integration between the two projects and offering a robust and scalable structure for application development.

## ⚙️ Features

- Create a Node.js project with or without TypeScript support.
- Customizable folder structure for better project organization.
- Initial configuration for databases such as NeonDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Kibana/Elasticsearch.
- Easy npm script setup to start the server and test database connections.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v10 or higher)

### 📦 Usage

To create a new project using the node-backend-kickstart script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/node-backend-kickstart.git
        cd node-backend-kickstart
    ```

2. Make the setup script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x create_node.sh
    ```

3. Run the setup script with your desired project name and template:

    ```bash
    ./create_node.sh project_name [-t] [--neon] [--postgres] [--mysql] [--mongo] [--kibana] [--dbclient]
    ```

    Replace project_name with your desired project name. Add options as needed:

    `-t, --typescript`: Initialize the project using TypeScript.

    `--neon`: Include configuration for NeonDB.

    `--postgres`: Include configuration for PostgreSQL.

    `--mysql`: Include configuration for MySQL.

    `--mongo`: Include configuration for MongoDB.

    `--kibana`: Include configuration for Kibana/Elasticsearch.

    `--dbclient`: When using NeonDB, specify the database client type (neon, pg, or postgres).

### 💡 Example

To create a project named `my-backend-project` using NeonDB:

```bash
./create_node.sh my-backend-project --neon
```

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

After running the script, your project will have the following folder structure:

```bash
my-backend-project/
├── src/
│   ├── /config/            # Server configurations (e.g., environment variables)
│   ├── /controllers/       # Controllers (business logic)
│   ├── /models/            # Data models (e.g., mongoose schemas)
│   ├── /routes/            # Route definitions
│   ├── /services/          # Services (e.g., external API integration)
│   ├── /middlewares/       # Express middlewares
│   ├── /utils/             # Utility functions and helpers
│   ├── /tests/             # Unit tests
│   └── server.js           # Server entry point (app initialization)
├── .gitignore
├── .env                    # Environment configurations
└── package.json
```

## 📝 Example .env File

Below is an example of the .env file generated by the script. This file contains the essential environment variables needed to configure your development environment:

```bash
# Common settings
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=10000

# NeonDB
NEON_ENDPOINT_ID=your_neon_db_url_here
DB_CLIENT=neon
PGHOST=your_postgres_host_here
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=your_postgres_user_here
PGPASSWORD=your_postgres_password_here
PGDATABASE=your_postgres_database_here
```

### ⚙️ Configuration

The script automatically sets up the development environment, including essential dependencies and scripts in package.json. It also generates a .env file for configuring project-specific environment variables.

### 🌐 Integração com NeonDB

The project includes built-in support for NeonDB (<https://neon.tech>), a modern and efficient PostgreSQL database service for web applications. NeonDB offers a seamless cloud database experience with an architecture that supports scalable workloads and high performance.

The current implementation is basic, focusing on establishing a functional connection with NeonDB and other databases as a starting point. This project is in its early stages and will be improved over time, with future updates planned to include backend security enhancements and system architecture improvements.

For more information on how to set up and use NeonDB, refer to the official documentation. (<https://neon.tech/docs/introduction>).

### 📝 Scripts

npm start: Starts the development server.
npm dbConnection: Tests database connection.

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need for a simplified and organized Node.js project setup, with the intention of covering both the client (frontend) and server (backend) sides. Special thanks to the Node.js, Express, and NeonDB communities for their excellent tools and documentation.
